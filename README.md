# Prediction of Uncertain Visual Trajectories



This repository contains behavior data how individuals make predictions under uncertainty. This study investigates the prediction strategies employed by participants when extrapolating uncertain visual trajectories. 
Participants completed a trajectory extrapolation task with two types of paths: Independent and Identical Distribution (IID) and Random Walk (RDW). 
The DDM was employed to gain a deeper understanding of participantsâ€™ trajectory extrapolation strategies.



This repository contains:

- **Behavior Data**: this folder contains raw data and experiment data preprocessing scripts.
- **Path**: this folder contains the codes for generating the paths as well as the paths used in the experiment.
- **DDM**: this folder contains the results of fitting the Drift-Diffusion Model.
